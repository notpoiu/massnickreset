# Mass Nick Reset
bot is built using [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) and loops through every member in the guild when the `b!unnickall` command is run and unnicks every member.
<br>
### Building the project
first you need to clone the project so type in cmd:
```
git clone https://github.com/notpoiu/massnickreset
```

then open up the folder in command prompt:
`C:\Users\Admin\Desktop> cd massnickreset`
<br>
then install the requirements by typing this:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
then change the token in `config.json` (and maybe the prefix too)
and to run it type: `python massnickreseter.py`
<br>
<br>
<br>
WARNING you need to have these checkboxes checked or else the bot wont be able to see the guild members in your guild. You can find it at the end of the bot tab in [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
