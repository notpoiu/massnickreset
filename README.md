# Mass Nick Reset
bot is built using [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) and loops through every member in the guild when the `b!unnickall` command is run and unnicks every member.

### Building the project
first you need to clone the project so type in cmd:
```
git clone https://github.com/notpoiu/massnickreset
```
then open up the folder in command prompt:
`C:\Users\Admin\Desktop> cd massnickreset`

then install the requirements by typing this:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
then change the token and change the guild ids of the slash commands and tweak the project to your liking :)
and to run it type: `python massnickreseter.py`
